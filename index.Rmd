### What is Python

<h4> What is Python?</h4>
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[28]
<p>
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
<p>
Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting.
<p>
Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
<p>
The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release." No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. 
With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x and later are supported.
<p>
Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free and open-source reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.

### The Everybody Pays Principle

With a view to keeping the ticket prices low and accessible to everyone, PyCons around the world use the "Everybody Pays" principle.

We confirm that this principle is observed by PyCon Ireland, even applying it to the board of directors, and the management team.

This principle is well explained in the following post by Jesse Noller:

jessenoller.com/blog/2011/05/25/pycon-everybody-pays

We point out that there are contingencies for financial aid assistance. Revert to the conference organizing team if this is something you wish to discuss.

We will not engage in discussions about the merits of this policy.
