### What is an Event Gazette

* An event gazette is a publication of details relevant to the operation of an event.

* The gazette is primarily intended for potential speakers and sponsors, but can be made accessible to the general public. 

 - The gazette should not be considered to be the main website for PyCon Ireland 2020.

* The gazette will be updated and amended on an ongoing basis. 

 - If details are absent, the omission must not be assumed to be deliberate or permanent.

* The Python community is invited to participate in the creation of content for the gazette.

 -  Please contact Python Ireland by sending an email to "contact [at] python [dot] ie"

* Python Ireland reserves the right to expedite the acceptance of submissions before the end of the CFP period, to mitigate the financial impact on the Speaker's participation.

 - There is alway events taking place in the city each weekend. 

 - You can mitigate costs by booking something immediately.


### The Everybody Pays Principle

With a view to keeping the ticket prices low and accessible to everyone, PyCons around the world use the "Everybody Pays" principle.

We confirm that this principle is observed by PyCon Ireland, even applying it to the board of directors, and the management team.

This principle is well explained in the following post by Jesse Noller:

jessenoller.com/blog/2011/05/25/pycon-everybody-pays

We point out that there are contingencies for financial aid assistance. Revert to the conference organizing team if this is something you wish to discuss.

We will not engage in discussions about the merits of this policy.

### Recording of Talks

Please note that there will be video recording of the talks, which will then be published on Youtube under the Youtube licence:

### Scheduling Considerations

* Many Pycon Ireland speakers are travelling a long distance in order to participate in Pycon Ireland. 
* We will devise a scheduling plan that does not place an undue burden on those travelling.
* Constructively, this means we tend to schedule locally based speakers in the opening and closing sessions.
