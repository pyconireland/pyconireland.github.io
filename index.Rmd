### The Everybody Pays Principle

With a view to keeping the ticket prices low and accessible to everyone, PyCons around the world use the "Everybody Pays" principle.

We confirm that this principle is observed by PyCon Ireland, even applying it to the board of directors, and the management team.

This principle is well explained in the following post by Jesse Noller:

jessenoller.com/blog/2011/05/25/pycon-everybody-pays

We point out that there are contingencies for financial aid assistance. Revert to the conference organizing team if this is something you wish to discuss.

We will not engage in discussions about the merits of this policy.

### Recording of Talks

Please note that there will be video recording of the talks, which will then be published on Youtube under the Youtube licence:
